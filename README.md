# VehicleSilhouetteClassification
## Abstract   
3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects.   
## Purpose   
The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.
